# CO2 Emissions Calculator

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Streamlit-based web application that helps companies calculate their carbon footprint and generate professional CO2 emissions reports. The application features user authentication, data persistence, improved chart visualizations, and processes CSV data containing various business activities (electricity consumption, fuel usage, transportation, etc.). Users can create accounts, save calculation history, upload activity data, visualize emissions through interactive charts with better label positioning, and generate comprehensive PDF reports for sustainability reporting and compliance purposes.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Streamlit Framework**: Single-page web application with sidebar navigation for company information input and main content area for data upload, visualization, and report generation
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Uses Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects for dynamic charts including pie charts for emissions breakdown by activity type and time-series visualizations for monthly trends
- **Session State Management**: Maintains user data (company information and calculated emissions) across page interactions to preserve workflow state

### Backend Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Core functionality separated into utility modules:
  - `EmissionsCalculator`: Handles all emission calculations using predefined emission factors
  - `DataValidator`: Validates CSV input data structure, data types, and value ranges
  - `PDFGenerator`: Creates professional PDF reports using ReportLab library
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: CSV upload â†’ validation â†’ emission calculations â†’ visualization â†’ PDF generation
- **Emission Factors Database**: Centralized repository of CO2 emission factors for various activities (electricity, fuels, transportation) sourced from UK Government GHG Conversion Factors 2023, EPA guidelines, and IPCC standards

### Data Architecture
- **CSV Input Format**: Expects structured data with columns for activity_type, category, amount, unit, and optional date
- **In-Memory Processing**: All data processing occurs in memory using Pandas DataFrames with no persistent storage
- **Flexible Unit Handling**: Supports multiple unit types (kWh, MWh, liters, gallons, kg, tonnes, km, miles) with automatic conversion to appropriate emission factors

### Report Generation
- **PDF Creation**: Uses ReportLab library to generate professional reports with custom styling, charts, and detailed breakdowns
- **Multi-Section Reports**: Includes executive summary, detailed emissions breakdown, visualizations, and optional recommendations section
- **Download Functionality**: Provides direct PDF download through Streamlit's download button with base64 encoding
